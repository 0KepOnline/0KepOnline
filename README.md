## Hello! I make Spore mods and like to experiment during this.

My journey has started on 22th of April 2018, when I've launched Spore for the first time. I was excited by the Model-in-Picture technology Spore uses and it became my first experimenting field then. In 2019 I helped Spore Wiki -ru with a lot of articles and became an administrator of it. I've been experimenting a lot then, in summer of 2020 me and [A-xesey](https://github.com/A-xesey) were researching Spore files every day.

On 29th of October I found my first real filenames, they were `physical_chorus_30sec` and `mahnamahna_loop_25sec`. Later I started searching them in expansions and even Darkspore and currently have found more than **20 000** filenames. Now they can be found in `reg_*.txt` files of [SporeModder FX](https://github.com/emd4600/SporeModder-FX).

From late 2020 I'm also experimenting with the oficcial Spore site (http://spore.com). During the next years I've digged out a lot of interesting data from it.

In 2021 I've started experimenting with city music and adventures. I used [Cheat Engine](https://github.com/cheat-engine/cheat-engine) to change Spore values in RAM and this opened a lot of new ways to experiment for me.
* On 15th of June I've added real Grox creations as adventure cast.
* On 19th of June I've changed the adventure model type to `ScenarioPlanet` and saved it as a planet template. Later that day I've modified the adventure with HEX editor and changed the terrain script of it.
* **On the night of 19th/20th of June I found an exploit which gives the ability to select any Spore sound as an act music.**
* On 29th of June I was playing with terrain scripts and accidentally found a way to place any Spore 3D model (with corresponding .prop file) on a planet with `terrainScriptModels` property. This method was very uncomfortable to use and I continued experimenting with 3D models placing.
* On 3rd of July I found a way to add any planet effect using the `visualStyle` property of terrain scripts.
* On the night of 12th/13th of July I was experimenting with `PaletteItems`. Then it helped me with making of my mods a lot.
* **On 14th of July I found a way to add 3D models as adventure cast, using the disguise ability of gameplay effects.**
* **On the next day I've started the making of [Skinning Objects Pack](https://github.com/0KepOnline/SPOREMod_SkinningObjectsPack) mod.** I've used my July 12th/13th experimental project as a template for it. After a month of active development, it was abandoned for over 9 months and was revived after I've found [Universal Property Enhancer](https://github.com/Zarklord/UniversalPropertyEnhancer) for me.
* **On 6th of August I've started the making of Act Music mod, which was merged with [Liskomato](https://github.com/Liskomato)'s [Share-Safe Music](https://github.com/Liskomato/Spore-ShareSafeMusic) mod on 30th of September.**
* On 16th of September after playing with terrain scripts I added a custom planet texture with `terrainThemeAboveDetail2` property.

**[My first mod was published on 26th of October. It fixes a hidden Cake Editor.](https://github.com/0KepOnline/SPOREMod_CakeEditor)**

Currently I'm working on **Skinning Objects Pack** and **Share-Safe Music** mods. :P
